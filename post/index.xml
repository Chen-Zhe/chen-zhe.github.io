      <description>Not long ago, I was tasked to improve our Spark application&amp;rsquo;s runtime performance as some modules takes 7 hours or more to complete on datasets that are not considered very large.

I was able to achieve 30% ~ 80% reduction of runtime, depending on how well the module was written and the nature of operations.</description>
