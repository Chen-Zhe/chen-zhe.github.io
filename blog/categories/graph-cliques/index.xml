When I was with DataSpark, I was part of a product team building a telco-specific solution that optimizes a telco operator&amp;rsquo;s spending on cell site upgrades to maximize return on investment (ROI). Requested by one of our clients, I designed, implemented and deployed this algorithm to identify cell sector clusters that share user load. Discovery of the sharing capability reduces the need to upgrade cell sites and hence saves upgrade cost.</description>

      <description>GraphX is a powerful component in Spark that allows graph-based programming and manipulation at very large scale. The only drawback is that it run on RDD and not DataFrame as I&amp;rsquo;m used to in Spark 2.2. Although a Spark package called GraphFrames is available to extend GraphX&amp;rsquo;s power to DataFrame, I recon it&amp;rsquo;s still easier to learn to construct a graph using GraphX and RDD than importing the package in Spark.</description>
