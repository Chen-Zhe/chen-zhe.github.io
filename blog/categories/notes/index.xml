      <description>Updates on 2021-02-20: furnish missing details
Recently I&amp;rsquo;ve used AWS to train machine learning / deep learning models and run inferences, and here are my notes and observations about the platform for this purpose
Overall speaking, AWS is a complex platform with a rather steep learning curve if I were to take advantage of services other than EC2 itself.
Here are my notes for services that I&amp;rsquo;ve used throughout the rapid-paced learning journey and hopefully they can be of help to others.</description>

      <description>TL;DR
To pose myself as a good software engineer candidate, I need to:
 Demonstrate passion to learn Provide more utility to the job position as a senior engineer Keep my resume short and relevant Tailor my resume for each position that I apply to Be mentally prepared for a project with relevancy to the position I&amp;rsquo;m applying to Not forget about the basics of computing (data structure and algorithms) Demonstrate Passion for coding  Background In the past few weeks, I participated in 3 interview sessions to hire more software engineers for developing the Spark ETL pipeline (using Scala) of a product.</description>

      <title>Basic usage of GraphX for clique detection</title>

      <description>GraphX is a powerful component in Spark that allows graph-based programming and manipulation at very large scale. The only drawback is that it run on RDD and not DataFrame as I&amp;rsquo;m used to in Spark 2.2. Although a Spark package called GraphFrames is available to extend GraphX&amp;rsquo;s power to DataFrame, I recon it&amp;rsquo;s still easier to learn to construct a graph using GraphX and RDD than importing the package in Spark.</description>
