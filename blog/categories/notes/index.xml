      <description>Updates 2022-01-04: To quote AWS support, &amp;ldquo;Over the last few months, we have seen a rapid increase in customer demand for our high-performance GPU instances. Several AWS teams are still working around the clock to provision additional capacity for our customers and remediate this situation.&amp;rdquo; Currently it has been very difficult to launch g4dn.xlarge spot instances without getting spot capacity error. I advise wait until night at East Coast to try again and launch g4dn.</description>

      <description>TL;DR
To pose myself as a good software engineer candidate, I need to:
 Demonstrate passion to learn Provide more utility to the job position as a senior engineer Keep my resume short and relevant Tailor my resume for each position that I apply to Be mentally prepared for a project with relevancy to the position I&amp;rsquo;m applying to Not forget about the basics of computing (data structure and algorithms) Demonstrate Passion for coding  Background In the past few weeks, I participated in 3 interview sessions to hire more software engineers for developing the Spark ETL pipeline (using Scala) of a product.</description>

      <title>Basic usage of GraphX for clique detection</title>

      <description>GraphX is a powerful component in Spark that allows graph-based programming and manipulation at very large scale. The only drawback is that it run on RDD and not DataFrame as I&amp;rsquo;m used to in Spark 2.2. Although a Spark package called GraphFrames is available to extend GraphX&amp;rsquo;s power to DataFrame, I recon it&amp;rsquo;s still easier to learn to construct a graph using GraphX and RDD than importing the package in Spark.</description>
