      <description>Updates 2022-01-04: To quote AWS support, &amp;ldquo;Over the last few months, we have seen a rapid increase in customer demand for our high-performance GPU instances. Several AWS teams are still working around the clock to provision additional capacity for our customers and remediate this situation.&amp;rdquo; Currently it has been very difficult to launch g4dn.xlarge spot instances without getting spot capacity error. I advise wait until night at East Coast to try again and launch g4dn.</description>
